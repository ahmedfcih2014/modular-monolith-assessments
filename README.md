# Modular Monolith Assessments

A hands-on learning repository for exploring and implementing **Modular Monolith Architecture** patterns and practices.

## About

This repository serves as a practical demonstration of concepts learned from the [Software Architecture Essentials](https://www.udemy.com/course/software-architecture-essentials/) course on Udemy. It contains implementations, experiments, and assessments focused on modular monolith design principles.

## What is a Modular Monolith?

A modular monolith is an architectural style that structures an application as a single deployable unit while maintaining clear module boundaries internally. It combines the simplicity of monolithic deployment with the organizational benefits of modular design.

### Key Characteristics

- **Single Deployment Unit** - The entire application is deployed as one artifact
- **Clear Module Boundaries** - Well-defined interfaces between modules
- **Encapsulated Data** - Each module owns its data and exposes it through APIs
- **Independent Development** - Teams can work on modules independently
- **Easier Migration Path** - Can evolve into microservices if needed

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/modular-monolith-assessments.git

# Navigate to the project
